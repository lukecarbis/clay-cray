Hi! We’re Lindy & Talia, two Sunshine Coast potters. In this episode we introduce ourselves, tell the stories of how we got into pottery, and also how we met!

We also give you the low down on our studios and what they’re like. And we also want to let you know what you can expect from the podcast - lots of fun, pottery talk, and stories!
