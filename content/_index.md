Tune in for a new podcast with Lindy ([A Little Creative](https://alittlecreative.com.au)) and Talia ([Wattle Ceramics](https://talia.au)) as they talk all about working, teaching and making with clay.

These two talented Sunshine Coast locals combine the endless demands of parenthood, running a small-business, and also trying to getting their own hands muddy and creative everyday. The results of this can leave them feeling a little bit crazy!

Clay-Cray describes their daily lives, their passion for art and creativity, and how teaching simultaneously fills they cup, and helps drain it out at times too.
